# What's for Dinner

**Description:** What do you want for dinner? It's a simple question that creates profound fear and dread -- what sounds good? What will taste good AND meet my dietary requirements? What's for Dinner? takes the stress out of mealtime planning by helping you plan a week at a time and even puts together your food order for you!

**User Story** As a busy, working adult with special dietary needs, I need to take the stress out of mealtime planning so I can plan and prepare healthier meals for myself or my family.
